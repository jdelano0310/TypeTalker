This is a simple Windows form app, written in C#, that speaks and displays the key pressed on the keyboard and flashes a random color. It says "mouse click" if, well, the mouse is clicked.
If a key is pressed that isn't an actual number, letter or punctuation than a random sound is played with a random color.

It aims to ignore anything that could allow the child to accidentally close the app, though it is not 100% proficient at this.

I wrote this for my grand child (Caius) and renamed it after my second gandchild has shown interest in playing with it. 
Because of the sounds when no character is pressed, he calls this "bloop" ðŸ˜‚ 

I decided to make a few changes given they're getting older and upload it here.
